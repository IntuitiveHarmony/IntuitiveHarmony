Curiosity, knowledge, growth and improvement are all motivators for me to keep expanding upon my various disciplines of study. I continually draw upon my varied experiences from the music, management, HVAC, plumbing, culinary and coding worlds. I combine them with my explorations of philosophy and logic in order to enrich my life and the lives of others.

Currently, my primary focus is on computer programming with the ultimate goal of creating software-based musical instruments that are accessible to individuals of all skill levels, including those who are new to music as well as experienced musicians. I am motivated to develop these tools in order to provide a intuitive and creative platform for people to explore and express their musical abilities.
